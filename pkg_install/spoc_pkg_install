# install recent versions of R and RStudio, open RStudio and run the commands below one at a time, to install the required packages

# it's normally better, and often necessary, to have recent versions of all packages, so install even those you already had

# if you get an error message about Rtools, follow the instructions in that message -- it may involve installing the Rtools program (from the link provided in the error message) outside R, and adding it to the path following the instructions in that website

# EVERY TIME you get an ERROR message complaining about a package, (re)install that package and try again

# after installing all packages, load each package with library() and check if there are additional error messages, in which case do as above
